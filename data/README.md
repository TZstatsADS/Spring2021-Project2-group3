# Project 2: Shiny App Development

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here.

In particular, there are three CSV files:

  activity_dataset.csv  : NYC public activities dataset
  casebyzipcode.csv     : COVID positivity stats per zipcode
  data-by-modzcta.csv   : COVID Case stats per zipcode

Other datafiles are used in the project but are downloaded in global.R.
